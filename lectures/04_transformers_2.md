# Transformers II

## Transformers

- We will continue to look at
    - Encoder-only/decoder-only models
    - In-context Learning
    - Parameter-efficient transformers
    - Low-rank adapters
    - Model distillation
    - Sentence Transformers
    - Reinforcement learning with transformers

---

## Encoder-Decoder Transformers

- Originally, transformers had an encoder and decoder
- The encoder for input sequence and decoder for output sequence
- For machine translation, the decoder produces the text in the foreign language
- For language modelling, the decoder produces the next word in the sequence
    - Decoder output is input shifted by one word

---

## Encoder-Only Transformers

- In encoder-only transformers, the decoder is removed
- These models produce an output for the sequence
- For example, in BERT the output is a vector for each token in the input sequence

---

## Decoder-Only Transformers

- In decoder-only transformers, the encoder is removed
- This is used by models such as GPT
- They are focused on generation and trained on next word prediction

---

## Fine-tuning Transformers

- Transformers are typically trained on a large corpus of text
- The model is then fine-tuned on a specific task
- In order to fine-tune, we take the model and then add a task-specific head
- The model is trained as usual, but the weights are initialized from the pre-trained model

---

## In-content Learning

- In-context learning is a technique to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task
- It does not require fine-tuning the entire model (i.e., updating the weights)
- Transformers are capable of in-context learning if trained on a diverse set of tasks

---

## Prompt engineering

- Techniques for prompt engineering:
    - Zero-shot learning
    - Few-shot learning
    - Chain of thought
    - Prefix tuning

---

## Parameter-efficient Transformers

- Transformers are very large models
- Most don't fit on a single GPU
- Reducing the number of parameters is possible
- Trade-off between model size and performance

---

## Model distillation

- Model distillation is a technique to train a smaller model to mimic a larger model
- The smaller model is trained on the output of the larger model
- DistilBERT was able to reduce the size of BERT by 40% while maintaining 97% of the performance

---

## Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning

- Language models such as GPT-3 have billions of parameters
- This makes them very expensive to train
- Parameter-efficient transformers are designed to be smaller and faster to train

---

## Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)

- Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) are a technique to allow efficient training of large models
- The idea is to add a small adapter layer to each transformer layer
- This adapter layer calculates a low-rank delta, $\Delta W$, that is added to the weights of the self-attention layer

\\[ W_{new} = W_{old} + \Delta W \\]

---

## Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)

- The delta is a product of two low-rank matrices with $r \ll d$.
- Faster to train
- Smaller memory footprint
    - Not less than inference on the full model!

---

## Quantization

- Quantization is a technique to reduce the precision of the weights
- Instead of 32-bit floating-point numbers, we use 8-bit integers
- This reduces the memory footprint and speeds up training

---

## Quantization Precision Levels

- Floating-point numbers consist of a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa

\\[ \text{float} = (-1)^s \times 2^{e} \times 1.m \\]

NB Mantissa is a binary fraction

---

## Quantization Precision Levels

| Bits | Sign | Exponent | Mantissa |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| 64   | 1    | 11       | 52       |
| 32   | 1    | 8        | 23       |
| 16   | 1    | 5        | 10       |
| 8    | 1    | 3        | 4        |


---

## Affine Quantization

We can quantize to integers using the following formula:

\\[ x_q = \text{round}(\frac{x}{s} + Z ) \\]

Where $s$ is the scale factor and $Z$ is the zero-point

This allows us to quantize down to 8, 4 or even 2 bits.

---

## Quantization

- Quantization can be done in two ways:
    - Post-training quantization
    - Quantization-aware training

---

## Post-training Quantization

- Post-training quantization is done after the model is trained
- The weights are quantized to a lower precision
- Further training on the quantized model can improve performance

---

## Quantization-aware Training

- During forward passes, weights and activations are simulated as quantized (e.g., 8-bit integers)
- Stored as floating-point numbers during training.
- Gradients are calculated in full precision.
- Enables higher accuracy and fast inference.

---

## Sentence Transformers

- Sentence transformers are models that take a sentence as input and produce a vector representation
- These vectors can be used for tasks such as semantic similarity, clustering, and classification

---

## Siamese Networks

- Siamese network, uses two similar examples $x_1$ and $x_2$.

\\[ 
\begin{aligned}
h_1 &= f(x_1)\\\\
h_2 &= f(x_2)\\\\
\text{similarity} &= \text{cosine}(h_1, h_2)
\end{aligned}
\\]

---

## Triplet loss

- Triplet loss, uses a positive example $x_p$ and a negative example $x_n$.

\\[ \text{loss} = \max(0, \text{margin} - \text{cosine}(h_a, h_p) + \text{cosine}(h_a, h_n)) \\]

---

## Sentence Transformer Output

- Mean pooling: average of the token embeddings
- Max pooling: maximum of the token embeddings
- CLS token: the output of a special token `[CLS]` in the transformer

---

## Using Sentence Transformers

- Textual similarity: cosine similarity between two vectors
- Classification: add a new network to predict class from vector
- Clustering: use k-means or hierarchical clustering
- Information Retrieval: use vectors to retrieve similar documents; often using vector database such as FAISS

---

## Reinforcement Learning with Transformers

- Combines reinforcement learning with human-provided feedback
- Used to train models such as GPT

---

## RLHF

1. Pre-train a model on a large corpus
2. Collect human feedback
    - Model generates answers
    - Human annotators rank results
3. Train a reward model
    - Predict a numerical reward from human feedback
4. Fine-tune the model using reinforcement learning
    - Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or other RL algorithms

---

## Why Reinforcement Learning?

- Align model with human values
- Handle ambiguous or subjective tasks
- Mitigate harmful behaviour

---

## Summary

- Transformers are a powerful architecture for NLP
- Most transformers are encoder-only or decoder-only
- Transformers can be fine-tuned for specific tasks
- Parameter efficient transformers can be trained more easily
- Sentence transformers are used for semantic similarity and other tasks
- Reinforcement learning can make transformers more human-like
